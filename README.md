# CCUR

## Data 
For Small Molecule and Pathogen, we follow data preprocessing and downloading follows https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI/blob/main/contrastive_vi/. 

## Files
main.py contains the CCUR method and relevant functions.
Mouse Protein contains experiments done for Mouse Protein. We follow https://github.com/abidlabs/contrastive for preprocessing. Data_Cortex_Nuclear.csv contains the data.
Small Molecule and Pathogen contain experiments run for the corresponding datasets.

## CFS
We compare results with CFS in this folder for each data. For corresponding files, we follow the original paper and its implementation which can be found here https://github.com/suinleelab/CFS/blob/master/contrastive_fs/.

## Simulation
This file contains simulations for both contrastive column and row selection.
