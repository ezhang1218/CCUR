# CCUR

## Data 
For Small Molecule and Pathogen, we follow data preprocessing and downloading follows https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI/blob/main/contrastive_vi/. 

## Files
main.py contains the CCUR method and relevant functions.

### Mouse Protein
This file contains experiments done for Mouse Protein. Data_Cortex_Nuclear.csv contains the data. The code used to generate images in Figures 2 and 5 can be found in this file.

### Small Molecules
This file contains experiments done for Small Molecules. The code used to generate images in Figure 3 and 6 can be found in this file.

### Pathogen
This file contains experiments done for Pathogen. The code used to generate images in Figure 4 and 7 can be found in this file.


## CFS
We compare results with CFS in this folder for each data. For corresponding files, we follow the original paper and its implementation which can be found here https://github.com/suinleelab/CFS/blob/master/contrastive_fs/.

## Simulation
This file contains simulations for both contrastive column and row selection. The code used to generate Figure 1 can be find in these files.
