For Small Molecule and Pathogen, we follow data preprocessing and downloading follows https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI/blob/main/contrastive_vi/. 

## Files
main.py contains the CCUR method and relevant functions.
Mouse Protein contains experiments done for Mouse Protein. We follow https://github.com/abidlabs/contrastive for preprocessing. Data_Cortex_Nuclear.csv contains the data.
Small Molecule and Pathogen contain experiments run for the corresponding datasets.

## CFS
For experiments run using CFS on each dataset, we follow the original paper and its implementation here https://github.com/suinleelab/CFS/blob/master/contrastive_fs/.
